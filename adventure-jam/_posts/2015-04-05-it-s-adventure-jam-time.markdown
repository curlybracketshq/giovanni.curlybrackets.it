title: It's AdventureJam time

The team is composed by [me]({{ site.url }}/about.html),
[Daniel](https://twitter.com/campoverdi),
[Francesco](https://twitter.com/pinakes), and
[Luca](https://twitter.com/lucaderosso).

The mission is to build a text-adventure in 14 days for the
[AdventureJam](http://adventurejam.org).

Well, we're not starting the project at full speed since I'm writing this post
while flying to meet my family in Italy for Easter holidays. The team is
therefore already missing one member, even before starting the competition, but
we're ready to achieve the goal anyway!

The best part about jams is precisely this: there's a clear goal and a finite
(short) amount of time to achieve it. This helps you stay focused and the time
scarsity lets you avoid energy in futile features and optimizations.

Right now we *only* know that the project will be a web-based text-adventure
built using [gist-txt](https://github.com/potomak/gist-txt), a tool I created
to share HTML5 adventure games.

The four of us will collaborate on the story and the game design. Daniel will
also draw some [illustrations](http://www.danielgreenfeld.com/). Francesco and
Luca will also care of [sound design and
music](https://soundcloud.com/youdontneedthis/).

More updates about the development of the project soon.<br>
Stay tuned!
