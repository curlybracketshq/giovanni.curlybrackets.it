The team consists of [me]({{ '/about.html' | relative_url }}), Daniel, Francesco, and Luca.

Our mission is to build a text adventure in 14 days for the [AdventureJam](https://gamejolt.com/c/adventuredev).

We're not kicking off the project at full speed, as I'm writing this post while flying to Italy to visit my family for Easter. As a result, our team is already short one member even before the competition begins, but we're determined to achieve our goal!

The best part about game jams is the clear objective and the finite, yet short, timeframe to achieve it. This helps maintain focus and prevents wasting time on unnecessary features and optimizations.

Right now, we *only* know that the project will be a web-based text adventure built using [gist-txt](https://github.com/potomak/gist-txt), a tool I created for sharing HTML5 adventure games.

The four of us will collaborate on the story and game design. Daniel will also provide [illustrations](http://www.danielgreenfeld.com/). Francesco and Luca will handle [sound design and music](https://soundcloud.com/youdontneedthis/).

More updates about the development of the project soon. Stay tuned!
