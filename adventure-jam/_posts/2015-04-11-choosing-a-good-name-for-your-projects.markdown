title: Choosing a good name for your projects

I have always found it difficult to decide on a name for my projects. Most of
the time I fail to even chose any name, which is a pretty easy way to prevent a
project from even being released. You could think it's a futile question
because the project itself is the most important thing. Well, the name you're
*not* choosing is what people would use to refer to your work. It's like a
project without a name doesn't even exist.

Deciding a name for your projects is a *creative* task: you can choose whatever
name you want, there are no constraints.

Choosing a name for your projects is *hard*: the name should reflect the style
and spirit of the project, it should also be catchy and easy to remember.

Projects themselves must be referenced anyway, which is why I usually refer to
them using *code names*, but be careful to find a real name as soon as you can
or else you're going to stick with the code name. This is an easy solution, but
most of the time you can do a lot better just giving it a little bit more
thought.

For our AdventureJam project we started with the code name *The daily routine*,
but after some time we decided to call the game *Routine*. In this case I think
we've been lucky to have found a good name from the beginning of the project.

The game we're working on is a text adventure that tries to better understand
the pros and cons of our daily routine. What is the subtle difference between a
life spent repeating the same actions day after day and a life you can consider
truly lived?

I'm happy to begin to tackle this broad topic with a little game, and hopefully
it will help me and my team comprehend how almost every aspect of our existence
has its own meaning, even when they become part of our routine.
