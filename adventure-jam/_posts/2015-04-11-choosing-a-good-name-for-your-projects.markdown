title: Choosing a Good Name for Your Projects

I have always found it challenging to decide on a name for my projects. Often, I fail to choose any name, which can be a significant barrier to releasing a project. You might think it's a trivial concern since the project itself is what truly matters. However, the name you choose is how people will refer to your work. Essentially, a project without a name doesn't quite exist.

Naming your projects is a *creative* task: you can choose any name you want; there are no constraints.

Choosing a name for your projects is also *difficult*: the name should reflect the style and spirit of the project and be catchy and easy to remember.

Projects need to be referenced, which is why I usually use *code names*. However, it's important to find a real name as soon as possible, or else you might become attached to the code name. Although this is a convenient solution, with a bit more thought, you can often come up with something much better.

For our [AdventureJam project]({% post_url adventure-jam/2015-04-05-it-s-adventure-jam-time %}), we started with the code name *The Daily Routine*, but eventually named the game *Routine*. In this case, I think we were fortunate to find a fitting name early in the project.

The game we're working on is a text adventure that also serves as a reflection on the pros and cons of our daily routines.

What is the subtle difference between a life spent repeating the same actions day after day and a life you can consider truly lived?

How does almost every aspect of our existence hold its own meaning, even when it becomes part of our routine?
