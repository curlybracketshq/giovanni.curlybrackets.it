I'm not skilled at drawing, but I decided to have fun and create the game image assets myself.

This is supposed to be a fox, the main character of the game:

![Fox drawing]({{ '/sdl-adventure-game/assets/fox.png' | relative_url }})

I tried a couple of free drawing tools for macOS (*Paintbrush*, *Pencil2D*), but without a drawing tablet, the result was too rough.

## Procreate

I ended up using **Procreate** on iPad to draw background images and animations.

After choosing the right brush and learning a few features, it was the perfect tool for the job.

I used the [Animation Assist](https://help.procreate.com/procreate/handbook/animation/animation-interface) and *onion skinning* features to draw animations.

[*ColorDrop*](https://help.procreate.com/procreate/handbook/colors/colors-interface#hvd8ohyd0wa), which allows you to fill an area with a color by dragging and dropping the current color on the drawing, was great, especially after I discovered the *threshold* parameter.

## Animation Sprites

To pack animation frame images into a single sprite, I used the [Online Texture Atlas Generator](https://umesh-kc.itch.io/free-online-texture-packer-alternative).

It's a great tool — simple and reliable — and I would recommend it for generating sprite sheets.
