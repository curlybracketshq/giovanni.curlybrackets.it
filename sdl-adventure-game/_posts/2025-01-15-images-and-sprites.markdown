I'm not good at drawing, but I decided to have fun and to draw the game image assets myself.

This is supposed to be a fox, the main character of the game:

![Fox drawing]({{ '/sdl-adventure-game/assets/fox.png' | relative_url }})

I tried a couple of free drawing tools for macOS (*Paintbrush*, *Pencil2D*), but without a drawing tablet the result was too rought.

## Procreate

I ended up using **Procreate** on iPad to draw background images and animations.

After choosing the right brush and learning a few features, it was the perfect tool for the job.

I used the [Animation Assist](https://help.procreate.com/procreate/handbook/animation/animation-interface) and *onion skinning* feature to draw animations.

[*ColorDrop*](https://help.procreate.com/procreate/handbook/colors/colors-interface#hvd8ohyd0wa), that allows you to fill an area with a color by dragging and dropping the current color on the drawing, was great, especially after I've found out about the *threshold* parameter.

## Animations sprites

To pack animation frame images into a single sprite I used [Online Texture Atlas Generator](https://umesh-kc.itch.io/free-online-texture-packer-alternative).

Great tool, simple and reliable, I would recommend it for generating sprite sheets.
