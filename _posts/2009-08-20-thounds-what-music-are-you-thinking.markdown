Hey,

I'd like to tell you about this new amazing project: **Thounds**.

It's a web application that lets you record your own *sounds* and share them
with your friends or *band members*. Doing so new songs will grow by mixing the
*thoughts* of everyone on the Internet.

The beta version it will be on line soon, have fun!

#### Update

The project has been shut down on 2012 and the website is not available anymore.
