Hey,

I'd like to tell you about this new amazing project: **Thounds**.

This web application let you record your own *sounds* and share them with your
friends or *band members*. Doing so new songs will grow by mixing the *thoughts*
of everyone on the Internet.

Now the project is still an alpha release, but it will be soon on line with the
beta release, have fun!

#### Update

The project has been closed on 2012 and the website is not available
anymore.
