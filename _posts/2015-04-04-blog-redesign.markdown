title: Blog redesign
layout: post

After about 5 years I decided to completely redesign this blog.

The new design has very few concepts in mind:

1. readability
1. design responsiveness
1. minimalism

This is how the blog used to look like:

![Old style]({{ '/assets/posts/old-style.png' | relative_url }})
