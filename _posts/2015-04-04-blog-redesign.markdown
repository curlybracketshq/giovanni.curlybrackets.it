title: Blog redesign
layout: post
---

After about 5 years I decided to completely redesign this blog.

The new design has very few concepts in mind:

1. readability
1. design responsiveness
1. minimalism

I took inspiration from a stile I created for an old project of mine that I
reworked a little bit to let it fit this blog.

This is how the old style index page looked like:

![Old style](/assets/posts/old-style.png)

What do you think of this redesign?

Did you like the old style the most?
