title: "The Daily Checklist: visualizing one year of 'things'"
layout: post
---

I always thought *one year* is a fairly long amount of time, but then I tried to
draw each day of the year as a square in a grid.

Visualizing each day in a year put things into perspective and made it clearer
how valuable is each moment we spend.

To put some content in the aforementioned visualization, I started tracking a
collection of *things* that I could do on an average day. I thought it would
have been interesting, once one year of data has been collected, to take a look
at the whole picture trying to recognize patterns.

The project started on 04/23/2016 and will end one year from that date, on
04/22/2017. During this period I will use a custom little Android app to keep
track of things that I do every day. The app posts each thing that I mark as
done to an HTTP API written in Go and running on Google App Engine.
