### Over confidence

Missing method/undefined constant errors

Stub methods in unit tests

### Missing QA

Maybe more test automation is needed, but it's hard to maintain

### Smaller PRs

Makes easier to review code and improve reviews' effectiveness

### Apply patterns

Easier to maintain and to spot common cases

### Set goals tools to monitor them

Example: queries

### Write more log entries

Makes it easier to follow code execution in production env and helps spotting
errors. Very useful on new features
