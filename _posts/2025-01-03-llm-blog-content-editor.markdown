title: Blog Content Editor Powered by LLM

I decided to use the OpenAI API to proofread and improve all the content on this blog.

First, I created a script to reformat all the posts to remove redundant new lines, such as single new lines in a paragraph that don't affect text layout. This was done to make it easier to review changes generated by the AI-powered content editor.

Then, I developed another script to call the OpenAI API with a simple prompt asking ChatGPT to proofread and enhance the input content. I ran this on each blog post. The prompt explicitly asks to minimize the number of changes because I wanted to correct grammar mistakes and make the posts easier to read while reducing the amount of non-original content.

* [`format_post.py`](https://github.com/curlybracketshq/giovanni.curlybrackets.it/blob/03d2b30c/scripts/format_post.py) - Removes redundant new lines from a post.
* [`post_diff.py`](https://github.com/curlybracketshq/giovanni.curlybrackets.it/blob/03d2b30c/scripts/post_diff.py) - Compares post content to check for differences other than new lines. I used this script to verify that the result of `format_post.py` didn't change the post's content.
* [`proof_read.py`](https://github.com/curlybracketshq/giovanni.curlybrackets.it/blob/03d2b30c/scripts/proof_read.py) - Generates an improved version of the input content.

The result is satisfactory. I spent some time manually reviewing the output from the LLM. It didn't hallucinate much. In some cases, it unnecessarily wrapped the entire post content in a markdown code block, but overall, the level of utility provided by tools such as the ChatGPT API is quite impressive.
