Twelve days ago [I posted about **gist-txt**]({% post_url
2015-03-05-a-minimal-tool-to-create-text-adventures %}): a tool I created to
build text adventures.

Since then it grew with simple, but powerful, new features.

I’d like to cite some that could be really helpful to create non trivial
adventure games:

* [custom stylesheets](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/2yrtb1/its_the_rgamedev_daily_random_discussion_thread/cpchn9k)
  (both global and per scene)
* [scene states and a template engine](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/2ynm8u/its_the_rgamedev_daily_random_discussion_thread/cpbeved)
* [a development environment](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/2z7lfh/its_the_rgamedev_daily_random_discussion_thread/cpguzrd)
* [a directory](http://potomak.github.io/gist-txt/text-adventures.html) to
  showcase your creations

The tool is still underdevelopment, but I think it’s almost ready and it would
be great if you would like to use it to develop a game for the next [Mini LD
#58](http://ludumdare.com/compo/2015/03/13/mini-ld-58-march-20-29/). I’m
definitely going to use it to build a text adventure for the
[AdventureJam](https://gamejolt.com/c/adventuredev)!

If you’re interested about gist-txt you can watch the repo at
[https://github.com/potomak/gist-txt](https://github.com/potomak/gist-txt), I’ll
also post periodic updates about its development at
[/r/gamedev](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/).
