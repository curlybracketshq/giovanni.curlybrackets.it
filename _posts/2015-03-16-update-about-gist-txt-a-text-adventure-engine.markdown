title: "Update about gist-txt: a text adventure engine"
layout: post
---

A couple of weeks ago I published a post [to introduce **gist-txt**]({% post_url
2015-03-05-a-minimal-tool-to-create-text-adventures %}): a tool I created to
build text adventures.

Since then I added some simple, but powerful, new features:

* [custom stylesheets](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/2yrtb1/its_the_rgamedev_daily_random_discussion_thread/cpchn9k)
  (both global and per scene)
* [scene states and a template engine](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/2ynm8u/its_the_rgamedev_daily_random_discussion_thread/cpbeved)
* [a development environment](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/2z7lfh/its_the_rgamedev_daily_random_discussion_thread/cpguzrd)
* [a directory](http://potomak.github.io/gist-txt/text-adventures.html) to
  showcase your creations
