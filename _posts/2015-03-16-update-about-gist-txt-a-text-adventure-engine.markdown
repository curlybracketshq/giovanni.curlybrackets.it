title: "Update on gist-txt: A Text Adventure Engine"
layout: post

A couple of weeks ago, I published a post [introducing **gist-txt**]({% post_url 2015-03-05-a-minimal-tool-to-create-text-adventures %}), a tool I created for building text adventures.

Since then, I've added some simple but powerful new features:

* [Custom stylesheets](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/2yrtb1/its_the_rgamedev_daily_random_discussion_thread/cpchn9k) (both global and per scene)
* [Scene states and a template engine](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/2ynm8u/its_the_rgamedev_daily_random_discussion_thread/cpbeved)
* [A development environment](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/2z7lfh/its_the_rgamedev_daily_random_discussion_thread/cpguzrd)
* [A showcase directory](http://potomak.github.io/gist-txt/text-adventures.html) for your creations
