Ludum Dare 28 marked my first participation in this game jam, an event I had always aspired to join. In 48 hours, I developed a video game focused on themes of choice, a hostile environment, and limited resources.

## What Went Right

* I completed the game!
* I enjoyed using Crafty.js as the game engine. Huge thanks to [@starwed](https://github.com/starwed) and [@kevinsimper](https://github.com/kevinsimper), two of the most prolific Crafty.js contributors.
* I managed to devise a reasonable game design quickly.

## What Went Wrong

* I resorted to pixel art since I'm not an artist, and it was the only feasible way for me to complete the graphics within 48 hours.
* I didn't publish any development posts or timelapses because I found it too challenging to code and maintain a social presence simultaneously.
* I wasn't able to devote enough time to developing music and sound effects.

Note: I created this game at H-Farm, one of the official jam gatherings, and the only one in Italy. Thanks to [Hackatron](http://hackatron.org/) for organizing the event.
