The 28th Ludum Dare has been the first for me. I really wanted to attend this
game jam and now I did and this is the first huge win for me. I built something
in 48 hours, specifically a video game about choice, a hostile environment, and
lack of resources.

Don't forget to play ~~and rate~~ ["Loop Desert"]({{ '/ld28' | relative_url }}).

## What went right

* I finished the game!
* I loved to use the Crafty.js engine as the main tool to develop the game, I
  would thank for this [@starwed](https://github.com/starwed) and
  [@kevinsimper](https://github.com/kevinsimper) two of the most productive
  Crafty.js contributors.
* I was happy with the final concept and I conceived it quickly enough.

## What went wrong

* I used pixel art as I'm not an artist and it was the only way for me to get
  the job done in 48 hours.
* I didn't publish anything (posts, timelapse) during development because I
  can't manage coding and sharing together.
* I would have done more work on music and sound effects but I hadn't enough
  time.

Note: I made this game at H-Farm, one of the official gatherings of the jam, the
only one in Italy. I'd like to thank [Hackatron](http://hackatron.org/) for the
organization of the event, great job guys.
