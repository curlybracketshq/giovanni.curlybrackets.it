Ludum Dare 28 was the first Ludum Dare I've ever attended. I always wanted to participate to this game jam. I built something in 48 hours, specifically a video game about choice, a hostile environment, and lack of resources.

## What went right

* I finished the game!
* I enjoyed using Crafty.js (game engine). Huge thanks to [@starwed](https://github.com/starwed) and [@kevinsimper](https://github.com/kevinsimper), two of the most prolific Crafty.js contributors.
* I was able to come up with a reasonable game design quickly.

## What went wrong

* I used pixel art as I'm not an artist and it was the only way for me to get the job done in 48 hours.
* I didn't publish anything (posts, timelapse) during development because I couldn't manage to both code and be social.
* I wasn't able to work enough on music and sound effects.

Note: I made this game at H-Farm, one of the official gatherings of the jam, the only one in Italy. Thanks to [Hackatron](http://hackatron.org/) for the event organization.
