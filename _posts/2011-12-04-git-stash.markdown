With *git stash*, you can temporarily set aside your current updates to focus on other tasks.

Use `git stash` to save the current state of your work:

```bash
$ git stash save "work in progress"
```

This command will stash your changes, resetting the working tree and index to match the tip of your current branch.

Now, you can attend to other tasks, such as fixing a bug or writing a test:

```bash
$ git commit -a -m "Fix typo"
```

Afterward, you can return to your previous work using `git stash apply`:

```bash
$ git stash apply
```

Stashed updates are queued. To view the queue of changes, run:

```bash
$ git stash list
```

Here is an example of what you might see:

```
stash@{0}: WIP on develop: 51bea1d Update license
stash@{1}: WIP on master: 9705ae6 Fix images
```

You can apply them individually using `git stash apply stash@{1}`.

You can clear out the list with `git stash clear`.
