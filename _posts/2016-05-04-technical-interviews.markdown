Technical interviews can be *exhausting*. It happened to me more than once to
screw up an interview because I was tired or unprepared.

There is also too much *variance*, so I think using some sort of *standard
score* would be helpful. In fact an ideal solution would be to use using
university exams scores to hire the most promising programmers.

The technical interviews process is *rewarding* when you succeed. If you get an
offer it feels like you're going to be part of a group of people who can solve
those same problems at least as good as you did.

That's also the reason why I feel *inadequate* when I fail.
