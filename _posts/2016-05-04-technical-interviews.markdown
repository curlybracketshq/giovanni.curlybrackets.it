I started to enjoy technical interviews, but I agree with many of my peers when
they say they're *exhausting*. It happened to me more than once to screw up an
interview because I was tired and when I tried to schedule more than one
interview in the same day I always underachieved in one of them.

I like them because I feel clever when I succeed at *hard* interviews, but it's
also a waste of time because the process is always almost the same. That's why
I think using some sort of *standard score* would be helpful. In fact an ideal
solution would be to use using university exams scores to hire the most
promising programmers, but it would imply an overly biased choice.

Technical interviews process is rewarding when you're able to solve problems
and quizzes. When and if you get an offer it feels like you're going to be part
of a group of people who can solve those same problems at least as good as you
did.

That's also the reason why I feel dumb when I fail, but that's part of the
game, and what I end up saying is that that's probably why I still don't build
rockets at NASA.

The thing that I completely disagree with is the whole A, B, and C players
thing. They say: As hire As and Bs hire Cs. Well I think that's not totally
correct because if your interview process includes problem solving you'll end up
with results that are precisely measurable and you can just adjust the
complexity of the problem to get As, Bs, or Cs.
