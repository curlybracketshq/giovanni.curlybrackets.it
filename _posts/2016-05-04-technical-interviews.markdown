Technical interviews can be *exhausting*. I've screwed up interviews more than once because I was either tired or unprepared.

There's also too much *variance*, so I believe using a *standardized score* could be helpful. An ideal solution might be relying on university exam scores to identify the most promising programmers.

The technical interview process is *rewarding* when you succeed. Receiving an offer feels like you're joining a group of people who can solve the same problems at least as well as you did.

That's also why I feel *inadequate* when I fail.
