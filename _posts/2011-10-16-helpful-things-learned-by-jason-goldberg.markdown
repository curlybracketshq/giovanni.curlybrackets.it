Here's some of the things learned by Jason Goldberg running Fab.com I totally agree with:

1. **Do one thing.**<br> Find one thing you can do really well and focus entirely on that one thing.
2. **Service matters more than sales.**<br> Sales go up and down. Service lasts forever.
3. **Make mistakes.**<br> Take risks. Move fast. Learn faster.
4. **Be transparent.**<br> The more people know, the better.
5. **Measure Everything.**
