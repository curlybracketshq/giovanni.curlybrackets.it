Here are some of the lessons learned by Jason Goldberg while running Fab.com that I completely agree with:

1. **Do One Thing:**
   Find one thing you can do exceptionally well and focus entirely on that.

2. **Service Matters More Than Sales:**
   Sales may fluctuate, but exceptional service leaves a lasting impact.

3. **Make Mistakes:**
   Take risks, move quickly, and learn even faster.

4. **Be Transparent:**
   The more people know, the better informed they are.

5. **Measure Everything:**
   Constantly track and assess performance to improve.
