I've recently played [The Secret of Monkey Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_of_Monkey_Island) for perhaps the third time in my life. That game is awesome! Although it's a bit outdated now, it still holds great appeal.

I thought it would be cool to try my hand at making an adventure game myself. I'll use this as an opportunity to learn some Swift and SpriteKit, which seem like good choices for developing a 2D game.

I'll be writing posts to track my progress and share some of the knowledge I acquire. The plan is to publish at least one post every week.

In these posts, I would like to focus on the technical challenges and game design decisions I encounter.

I'll be sharing this information as an amateur iOS developer and aspiring game designer, so don't expect a very detailed guide on making 2D adventure games. I'm enjoying writing this, so I hope you'll enjoy reading it too.

I'm also seeking feedback, but I want to keep this blog simple, so I'll share these posts on [r/iOSProgramming](https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/) to start conversations.

## Conclusion

In the next post, I'll discuss the SpriteKit framework and how I've set up a cross-platform project.
